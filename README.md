# ProjectB

  A university project completed in a team of two. It has been the hardest project I have completed personally because of the many new aspects of programming that I had to 
teach myself starting from 0. It is a project which was aiming to introduce us into Distributed Systems. 
What we had to achieve was make a music streaming application that consists of servers, brokers and clients, using of course Sockets and Threads. The music would either stream
online, cut into chunks that would be sent one-by-one from the server to the client, or it could be sent as a full track, and then give the client the ability to stream it 
while offline. The UI was made in a poor design(it was not the main point of the project), in Android Studio
