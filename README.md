# Music Streaming Application

A university project completed in a team of two. It is an introductory project into the subject of Distributed Systems. It is relied on the broker pattern, consisting of some servers, brokers and clients. The music would either stream online, cut into chunks that would be sent one-by-one from the server to the client, or it could be sent as a full track, and then give the client the ability to stream it while offline. The UI was made in a poor design(it was not the main point of the project), in Android Studio.
